  "readme": "calmcard\n========\n\n**not-so-wild wildcard string matching**\n\nCalmcard provides a simple string pattern matching with `*` as the only special character which is a placeholder for\nany sequence of characters, unless it is escaped.\n\nCalmcard was made to have a `glob` like tool for arbitrary strings where slashes have no special meaning. It also does\nexplicitly not use regular expressions because of speed, proper escaping and because writing regular expression strings\nin JavaScript gets messy and unreadable very quick.\n\n## Examples\n\n* `foo*bar` will match \"foo123bar\"\n* `foo\\*bar` will match \"foo\\*bar\" but not \"foo123bar\"\n\n## Installation\n\nCurrently, calmcard is built for node.js and available via NPM.\n\n    npm install calmcard\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\n    var calmcard = require(\"calmcard\");\n\n    calmcard(\"foo*bar\", \"foo123bar\"); // -> true\n    calmcard(\"foo*bar\", \"foobar\"); // -> false\n```\n",
